{"Intro":"Love Island is my favorite show. There. I said it. If you are in the same boat as me, at the edge of your seat for the next  recoupling, then I’m sure you’ve also wondered what it takes for a couple to make it to that final firepit. What about that  couple has resonated with the public voters that determine who stays and who goes.  What about that couple’s story  can teach us about ourselves, and what kind of love we will vote for in the end.","Intro2":"Love Island has become an international sensation, with the show expanding to over 12 countries and over 32 seasons.  And with all this new data on singles, bombs, couples and dumpings, I’ve set to find out if there is anything I am learning from hours of mindless television.","Intro3":"For those of you new to the Love Island universe, the setup is pretty simple.  Sexy singles are marooned in a tropical villa, with coupling up being the only way to stay and win the prize money at the end.  A series of decisions made by the islanders and multiple live public votes decide who will make it through and who will be dumped from the island.","TA1a":{"plain":"Before our couples are formed, they are two individuals coming into a villa.  And the first thing we can learn about these love stories is that the longer we know these individuals the more likely we are to root for them at the end.","tagline":"","plain2":""},"TA1b":{"plain":"The earlier a single enters the villa is a large determinant of their status at the end.","tagline":"If you aren't in the villa by Day 9 your chances of winning are slim.","plain2":"75% of winners are in the villa by day 5 and 85% of winners have entered by day 9."},"TA2a":{"plain":"The second thing we can learn about our expectations of love is that, much like our singles, we also need to see a couple over time. We need time to see the ups and the downs, to judge whether we think their love is true.","tagline":"","plain2":""},"TA2b":{"plain":"And in the data we can see that, even if couples do not stay together the entire time, 70% of winning couples are together","tagline":"within the first 2 weeks.","plain2":""},"TA3a":{"plain":"But what is love without some loss? Winners are more likely than the other islanders to be in more than one couple. Love needs drama!","tagline":"","plain2":""},"TA3b":{"plain":"About half of our winning couples got together and","tagline":"stayed together.","plain2":"But that leaves the other half, coupling up 2, 3, 4, 5 and even 6 times!"},"TA4a":{"plain":"But in the end, this is a story about commitment (who would have guessed)! Who would have know that behind all those rock hard abs and make out challenges, we all are just looking for someone to pick us over and over again.","tagline":"","plain2":""},"TA4b":{"plain":"Winning couples are much more likely to","tagline":"choose each other multiple times.","plain2":"Even if that means recoupling after a break."},"TA5a":{"plain":"And once they are coupled, winning couples need to spend time together. Because what is a love story without all of the mundane time sitting around a pool in a string bikini.","tagline":"","plain2":""},"TA5b":{"plain":"","tagline":"Every single winning couple was together for over 7 days.","plain2":"If a couple is together more than 14 days, their possibility of winning rises to xx%"},"TA6a":{"plain":"And there we have it - our winners!","tagline":"","plain2":""},"Outro1":"When it comes to love, the romantic story of love and loss plays out even in our modern reality tv.  We romanticize  couples that have challenges, couples that break up and get back together, couples that have to work for love and are committed to the process.","Outro2":"And maybe that is the largest lesson of all, that love doesn’t come easy to anyone. Love is work, even on Love Island."}
